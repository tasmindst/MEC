						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the era of globalization to walk with the world, Bangladesh must have to be technology based. And for the development of technology we need talent and skilled Engineers. For this purpose, the Government of Bangladesh has emerged an enlighten institute, that is Mymensingh   Engineering College. This institute   is running with a group of brilliant students. It is arranged with EEE, CSE and CE department. Only the department of EEE is running here. The other departments will be opened soon. In every department we have a lot of ultramodern equipments, in which most of them are imported. The windmill and the solar panel are the exceptional machineries in Mymensingh Engineering College which are not generally seen in other universities of this country.<br/><br/>
						There are three departmental buildings for the three departments, two male halls, one female hall, a five storied library building, teachers and staff quarters etc. all totally thirteen modern architectural facilitated buildings in this campus. About 500 students can stay in the male and female halls. The laboratories of all the departments are full with modern equipments. There are lots of books from home and abroad in the study rooms, a seminar room and an online reading room in the library building. <br/><br/>
						At present, the campus is very charming with the students and the natural beauty. Students are always busy with many types of co-curricular activities.
